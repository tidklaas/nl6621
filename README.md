# Tools for Nufront's NL6621 WiFi SoC. 
So far only a tool for generating firmware images from binaries. More to be added when needed.

[Here](https://github.com/tidklaas/libopencm3/tree/nl6621) is a fork of libopencm3 for this SoC, the accompanying fork of libopencm3-examples is [here](https://github.com/tidklaas/libopencm3-examples/tree/nl6621).

More information on the NL6621 can be found at http://www.nl6621.net, with [this](http://www.nl6621.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=5&start=8#p454) post explaining how to run your own code on this chip.
